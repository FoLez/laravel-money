# ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
If you want to customize settings for your Money object, you need to specify settings for it.

To set setting:
```php
// Method #1
$money = money(1234, settings());

// Method #2
$money = money(1234);
$settings = settings(); // customize it as you want
$money->bind($settings);

// Method #3
$money = money(1234); // Every Money object has settings by default even if it is not provided
```

To get settings:
```php
$money = money(1234);
$money->settings();
```

‚ùó **NOTE**
All the settings that are not provided or not changed will have default values, which were configured in the config file.
